# Labeler-machine-code
This is a definite work in progress, since I am wokring on so much at once, and working from multiple locations I am going to use github to
try and keep track of everything..
1st stage of code: simply run a DC motor using a speed control for winding the labels.. A infared sensor is set up with adjustment to stop 
the motor with the next label lined up at the roller.. I do want to add a prime button to load the labels.. 





if button is not pressed and sensor is not reading a label then stop

if button is pressed or sensor is reading label then run motor
else stop
